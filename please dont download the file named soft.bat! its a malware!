if it says "SIGNING OUT! ERROR!" your computer is infected! if your wondering how i created it, i created it using notepad i did @echo off twice, please dont download it or if you have a computer file name "soft.bat" it will open 5 command prompts! then it will say "SIGNING OUT! ERROR!" then if you dont shut it down fast, it will make you sign up for windows again! install at your own risk!
